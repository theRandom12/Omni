You're Impossible To Underestimate.
You are the human equivalent of a participation trophy.
I'd challenge you to a battle of wits but I see you're unarmed.
If you were any dumber we'd have to water you twice a day.

Light travels faster than sound. This is why you appear bright until you speak.
There are 7.5 billion people in the world and yet I still got stuck in a conversation with you.
If you had a penny for every time you had a good idea, you would be living in a box on the streets.
You look like a Picasso painting but without any of the value.
